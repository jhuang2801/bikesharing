## Summary:
- There are a total of over 2.3 million number of trips made in August 2019. Over 80% of these trips are made by subscribers and the rest are customer usertypes. Male users comprised of over 65% while women users are only 25% (the rest are identified as "unknown"). 

- Most trip durations are around 5 hours long for both male and female users.

- The most popular bike usage times are around 8 AM and 5 PM on weekdays, possibly relating to work or school commute hours for both male and female users.

- "Customer" user types are more frequent on the weekends, while "subscriber" user types are more frequent on weekdays.

- The most popular starting locations are close to New York City public subway stations.

- Additional analyses could be performed by comparing bike activities by month to determine the overall trends for the year. For example, bike sharing activities are expected to be higher in warmer months than in cold months. Bike activities can also be compared to other public transportation or ride sharing to determine the most popular preferred methods to travel within the city.
